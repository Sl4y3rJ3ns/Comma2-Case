Oh no! You just broke your $1000 Comma Two case while trying to disassemble it. What
are you going to do about it?

...

Conveniently, you stumble across a Github page with an STL to replace the case for
your Comma Two. You are overjoyed that you found a replacement for your device that
has been sitting in the bottom of your drawer for months!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Items required: A 3d printer (FDM, SLA or any other kind), a UV-resistant material
(The original case was printed in ASA, but you can also use ABS), soldering iron, 4 
screws (Any kind M3x6mm, preferably hex) and 4 heat inserts of the size of the
previously mentioned screws.

Slicer used: OrcaSlicer

Slicer Settings: Anything you think is the strongest and will stay alive in the sun.

1. Print the STL provided in the repository.

2. Remove any supported that you may or may not have added in the slicer settings.

3. Heat your soldering iron up to 265 degrees Celsius. Put the insert on each screw
   hole and push in gently. MAKE SURE NOT TO TOUCH THE SOLDERING IRON OR THE INSERTS
   UNTIL SUFFICIENTLY COOLED DOWN!!!

4. Reassemble the Comma Two (hopefully without breaking it :p) and admire your hard
   work you have done to fix your device!
